# Build Tools Showcase

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of various build tools in a modern web development workflow. The application fetches a list of popular tools from a JSON file and displays them in a grid layout on the webpage. It uses Webpack for bundling, Babel for JavaScript transpilation, Sass for styling, and Jest for testing. The project is designed to be easily extendable and serves as a foundation for learning and integrating different tools in a web development project.
